C++ compiler
SFML library
<h2>Installing</h2>
Here's how to install the prerequisites on a Windows machine:

Install a C++ compiler, such as MinGW or Visual Studio
Download the SFML library from the official website (https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
Extract the downloaded archive to a convenient location on your machine
Add the SFML library to your compiler's include and library directories
<h2>Running the game</h2>
Once you have the prerequisites installed, follow these steps to run the game:
